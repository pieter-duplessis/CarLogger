# CarLogger
I have created this project for something fun on the side. The idea came from after I took my car for a service and had to have new tires fitted onto the front wheels. The idea was for a program to keep track of the things that happen to the car, then there is always a history, for example, when last you have rotated the tires or what the last kilometer reading was when it went for a service.

I have created the project in Eclipse Mars with GitHub for the repository. I’m keeping the project plain and simple. Still a few things that I want to add to improve the project a little bit more.
