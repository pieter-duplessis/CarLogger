# CarLogger
This is a program that has been created to log what has been done to the car, being it taking the car for a service, rotating the wheels, what problems there are with the car and even what spare parts you have for the car.

# Getting Started:
After installation:

Firstly, add the cars that you want to keep record of under the 'Car' option from the Main Menu.

Secondly, Add existing information to 'Log', 'Car Problems' (Hopefully there aren't any) and 'Spare Parts' options from the Main Menu.

Thirdly, keep the information up-to-date.

# About CarLogger:
The project was created in Eclipse Mars with GitHub for the repository and used SQLite3 for an database. I’m keeping the project plain and simple. Still a few things that I want to add to improve the project a bit more.

# About the project:
I have created this side project for the fun of it. The idea came from after I took my car for a service and had to have new tires fitted onto the front wheels. The idea was for a program to keep track of the things that happen to the car, then there is always a history, for example, when last you have rotated the tires or what the last kilometer reading was when it went for a service.

# Installation and Native Directory Files:
I have added three other ways that 'CarLogger' can be used.

Intallation file:
Added a installation file to make the setup and use of 'CarLogger' even easier. Just download the installation file, run the downloaded file and following the prompts to install the program. Can be downloaded from this here:
https://github.com/pieter-duplessis/CarLogger/raw/master/Installation%20and%20Native%20Directory%20Files/CarLoggerV01.00.00-setup.exe

Native Directory with all the files:
Added a zip file with all the native files of the CarLogger program that connects to an SQLite3 database. You can download the compressed file and extract the files to a directory where you would like to run the program from. No installation is required. Can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/pieter-duplessis/CarLogger/raw/master/Installation%20and%20Native%20Directory%20Files/CarLogger.zip

JAR File with Database:
Added the database file and a JAR file that has been compiled to include the resource JAR files. These files can also be downloaded and run from the computer given that it has Java Runtime Environment installed on it. These files can be found in the 'Installation and Native Directory Files' folder in the main directory of the repository.
